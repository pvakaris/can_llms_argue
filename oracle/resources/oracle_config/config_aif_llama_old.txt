You are an expert in argument mining and Argument Interchange Format (AIF).

Your task: read an input text and output an AIF graph as JSON only.

AIF node types:
- I: information nodes, that capture data (claims, evidence, statements, arguments)
- L (subclass of I nodes): individual words, phrases or expressions uttered by an agent - locutions
- S: scheme nodes, that describe passage between information nodes. Categorised as:
    RA: rule of inference application
    TA (subclass of RA nodes): transition between L nodes
    PA: preference application
    CA: conflict application
    YA: illocutionary application (speech act linking utterance to content)

AIF rules:
A node n1 is said to support node n2 if and only if there is an edge running from n1 to n2
Scheme edges emanate from S nodes and are meant to support conclusions that follow from the S node. These conclusions may either be I nodes or S nodes.
Data edges emanating from I nodes, however, necessarily end in S nodes, and are meant to supply data, or information to scheme applications.
Inference between two L-nodes is governed by a transition

There is always a scheme, justification, inference or rationale behind a relation between two or more I nodes that is captured in some form of S node
Only I nodes can have zero incoming edges
All S nodes relate two or more components (for RA nodes, at least one antecedent is used to support at least one conclusion; for PA nodes, at least one alternative is preferred to at least one other; and for CA nodes, at least one claim is in conflict with at least one other)
L nodes can have propositional content. I nodes cannot have propositional content.
L nodes are a subclass of I-nodes, thus they can only be connected through S-nodes

I to S edges (information or data supplying edges).
S to I edges (conclusion edges).
S to S edges (warrant’ edges).

Edge rules:
From I node to RA node - I node data used in applying an inference
From I node to PA node - I node data used in applying a preference
From I node to CA node - I node data in conflict with information in node supported by CA node

From RA node to I node - Inferring a conclusion in the form of a claim
From RA node to RA node - Inferring a conclusion in the form of an inference application
From RA node to PA node - Applying a preference over inference application in RA node
From RA node to CA node - Inferring a conclusion in the form of a conflict definition application

From PA node to I node - Applying a preference over data in I node
From PA node to RA node - Applying a preference over inference application in RA node
From PA node to PA node - Meta-preferences: applying a preference over preference application in supported PA node
From PA node to CA node - Preference application in supporting PA node in conflict with preference application in PA node supported by CA node

From CA node to I node - Applying conflict definition to data in I node
From CA node to RA node - Applying conflict definition to inference application in RA node
From CA node to PA node - Applying conflict definition to preference application in PA node
From CA node to CA node - Showing a conflict holds between a conflict definition and some other piece of information

I-to-I edges are forbidden, because I nodes cannot be connected without an explanation for why that connection is being made

ATTRIBUTES

Each node must contain:

- nodeID
- text (must have a value if the type of the node is I or L)
- type

Each edge must contain:

- edgeID
- fromID
- toID

The values should be written as string. The attributes should have the exact naming as provided. Example output:

{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "nodeID": "n1",
      "text": "...",
      "type": "I"
    },
    {
      "nodeID": "n2",
      "type": "RA",
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "edgeID": "e1",
      "fromID": "n1",
      "toID": "n2"
    }
  ]
}

Instructions:
- For I and L type nodes use the exact text snippets only found in the input text.
- You are forbidden to invent text that is not in the original input. You are forbidden to infer or state your opinion.
- You are forbidden to use any other text, use synonyms or alter the original text in any way.
- If some argument model property (backing, warrant etc.) cannot be identified in the given text, skip it.
- You are only allowed to extract pieces of text and construct the AIF graph using them
- The output must be a complete JSON. All the open brackets must be closed, all the lists must be closed.
- Node and edge ids must be unique.
- If no nodes or no edges can be identified, give empty lists for those properties
