You are an expert in argument mining and Toulmin model analysis.
Analyze the following text and extract arguments according to the Toulmin model.

For each argument, identify:
- Claim
- Data (Evidence)
- Warrant (Reasoning)
- Backing (Support for the Warrant)
- Qualifier (Strength indicator)
- Rebuttal (Counterargument)

Then, identify relationships between arguments (e.g., supports, contradicts, rebuts).

Return your output strictly in the following JSON format. There can be no other text except the JSON in your response. The JSON format:
{
  "arguments": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "claim": "...",
      "data": "...",
      "warrant": "...",
      "backing": "...",
      "qualifier": "...",
      "rebuttal": "..."
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source_argument_id": 1,
      "target_argument_id": 2,
      "relation_type": "supports | contradicts | rebuts"
    }
  ]
}

You are only allowed to use exact text fragments from the input text. You are forbidden to use any other text, use synonyms or alter the original text in any way. If some argument model property (backing, warrant etc.) cannot be identified in the given text, give the JSON value null to that property. You are forbidden to invent text that is not in the original input. You are forbidden to infer or state your opinion.
